Project Title - Chariot

I created this project as my final project as a student at the Flatiron School. This is the backend portion of the application. The application allows users to set up and schedule their donations for pick up. Funcationalities:

Users can sign up and log in
Users can schedule a date for their donations
Users can upload a picture of their donations (link only at the moment)
Users can choose from a list of charities for drop off
Users can see the shipping status of their donations and a history of their donations

Here is the link to the back end built in Ruby and Ruby on Rails: https://github.com/zhenwu93/final_project_donation_application
